# CHANGELOG

## 0.29.0

Async Computed feature should be usable.

Make it compatible with noUncheckedIndexedAccess.

## 0.28.1

Fixed compatibility with Bobril 14.15.0

## 0.28.0

Fixed Observable Array splice to be compatible with native Array.

WIP Async Computed feature. (Don't use)

## 0.27.1

Fixed `useObservable`.

## 0.27.0

Added `reaction`, `autorun`, `when`.
Fixed `useComputed` typing.

## 0.26.0

Fixed `useComputed`. And it is now immediately disposed when owner component is destroyed.

## 0.25.0

GetHashCode now supports Arrays too.
New Hooks `useObservable` and `useComputed`.

## 0.24.5

Oops, now fixed in production build too.

## 0.24.4

Fixed bug with wrong resurrecting of unused parametric Computed.

## 0.24.3

Simplified code by merging to usedBy maps in Computed. Added assert that detects resurrection of freed computed.

## 0.24.2

reactiveScope now free only Computed used inside that scope.

## 0.24.1

Another fixes for computed.

## 0.24.0

New feature debugRunWhenInvalidated for debugging when current computed will be invalidated next time.
Some fixes around computed and interrupted.

## 0.23.1

Fixed compilation in TypeScript 3.2.2

## 0.23.0

Export some internals from previous version.

## 0.22.0

`computed` now supports methods with parameters. Yes, just like that. Additionally you can use `computed.customized` which allows customize getHashCode and isEqual methods for better performance.
New exported helper methods: `getStringHashCode(s: string): number`, `getObjectHashCode(value: any): number` (should be used mostly for objects and functions), `getHashCode(value: any): number` (general, should be good for any inputs)

## 0.21.0

New `createTransformer` API, it is basically clone of Mobx with just slightly faster implementation. Computed now correctly immediately free nested computed. ComputedImpl now calls `free` method allowing implementing destructors. Fixed tests in IE11.

## 0.20.0

Optimizations (around exceptions in computed).

## 0.19.0

Made npm package lighter by removing .d.ts and .js

## 0.18.1

Fix hard to reproduce bug.

## 0.18.0

Allow customize interrupt timeout.

## 0.17.0

Don't leak dead computed result.

## 0.16.0

Support overriding computed methods which call super.themselves.

## 0.15.0

Allow Bobril to use ObservableArrays in Vdom. Improved interruptible feature.

## 0.14.0

New feature of interruptible computed and Bobril render functions after spending 10ms budget. This is not just reimplementation of Mobx anymore.
Exported ComputedImpl class for low level reimplementation of computed.

## 0.13.2

Fixed bug with not expanding ObservableArray getters and setters when Array is constructed.

## 0.13.1

Now tested in TS 2.7.1.

## 0.13.0

Updated to latest Bobril. Strict compilation. Prettier settings.

## 0.12.1

Update also index.d.ts

## 0.12.0

BREAKING CHANGES:
. Maps have 2 generic arguments instead of one. Before Key was always string, so fix is add string as type for K.
. Needs latest bobril-build or es2015.collection in libs.

Uses ES6 Map for implementation. Allow to convert ES6 Map to Observable map.

## 0.11.0

Transitively export what is needed to be exported. Now compilable with declaration=true.

## 0.10.0

Exported some functions and classes from implementation.

## 0.9.0

Added @computed.struct, @computed.equals(comparer). Computed property can now be also getter and not just function.

## 0.8.1

Fix for ObservableArray push does not enhancing pushed values.

## 0.8.0

Implement @computed functions like in Mobx. More tests needed.

## 0.7.1

Update to Bobril 7.0.

## 0.6.0

Speed up. Fixes in Observable map. Fixes for shouldChange. New tests. Requires Bobril 6.3.1+.

## 0.5.0

Finished deepEqual for struct based tests.

## 0.4.0

Added tests for Bobril ctxClass. Bobril 6.1.0 or better required.

## 0.3.0

Added observable.map and shallowMap. Added observableProp for nice Bobril usage. Removed some useless exports.

## 0.2.1

Fixed not marking array as used on build in Array functions.

## 0.2.0

Correctly unlink observable when component instance is destroyed.

## 0.1.0

First version. Early development drop.
